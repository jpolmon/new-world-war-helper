<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is built to create an easier army generator than the current in game UI model for New World. Our goal is to take our information and eventually push it to a discord bot on several servers. Currently the project take login user data and creates a profile. On this profile we hold the users in game character information such as level main hand and off hand. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Built With
HTML, CSS, JS, Ant framework, JSON, Node JS 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
You simply run npm run seed which will populate it with seed data. You can also use the api to pull current discord sign up information on the webpage. run npm develop which will show the website.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

<!-- Prerequisites -->
We deployed it to Heroku and generated a fake war and had company members sign up to the war and displayed there information. 

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   sh
   git clone https://github.com/JeffM33/WarHelper
   



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
### Usage
This project can be used by a company in new world in order to see there war rooster and place there members in good teams that will make them more effective for in game wars. A good example of this would be like in game raids for WoW but with twice the people. It will be a helpful tool in creating war squads. 

<!-- ROAD MAP -->
### Road map
Right now it take logged in user data, and does pull request on a REST API, we want to eventually, be able to get an api we can do put request to to update the users signed up on the war from the webpage.

We would also like to incorporate a POST request in order to send wars out from the website to the selected discords from the user. 

We also want to incorporate a discord login feature in order to minimize the data we are storing on our website server, and keep the information on discord. This should also make it easier to keep up with the different sign ups rather than parsing the data twice. Once on the discord server, and once on the webpage. 

We want to add a Company leader login and put the add war behind this feature. 

We also want to add a how to use the bot, and select discord servers to add pings only on servers the user has the admin powers and rights to. 

A War Archive page to be listed on for the individual users as well so they can see the wars they participated in.

Standardized CSS page that will allow us to implement different word coloring based on faction player is associated with.
